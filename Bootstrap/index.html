The third planet from the sun was the one harbouring life. This little blue planet was called earth. On this Planet lived a young man named Jahil. Jahil was very interested in computers from a very young age. Soon he would become the first to write the neccesary code interplanetary explorers needed to power their warp drive ships. The technology was there but no one could succesfully program the quantum computers to make the calculations needed fast enough. This lead him to enrolling in a course with Rob Percival to set him on his way. Stay tuned for the next installation of Once Upon a time</p>
